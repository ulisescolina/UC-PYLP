Deep network architectures such as cortical algorithms are challenged by big data problems which result in lengthy and complex training. In this paper, we present a distributed cortical algorithm implementation for the unsupervised learning of big data based on a combined node-data parallelization scheme. A data sparsity measure is used to divide the data before distributing the columns in the network over many computing nodes based on the {MapReduce} framework. Experimental results on multiple datasets showed an average speedup of 8.1× compared to serial implementations.},

One main feature of ray tracing is parallelism and the mainstream computer market is switching to systems with multi-core. In this paper, in order to accelerate ray tracing to achieve real-time processing, we propose a data parallel kd-tree ray tracing algorithm on cell broadband engine (Cell/B.E.) which is a state-of-the-art multi-core processor. This paper expounds the feasibility and key issues of kd-tree ray tracing on the Cell/B.E. processor and introduces the implementation and cell-specific in ray tracing program design. The results highlight that our parallel algorithm for kd-tree ray tracing is scalable with a matrix of cores, resolutions or different object models. The execution time reduces from several minutes to several seconds.},

However, the boundary and synchronization problems become drawbacks to the processing efficiency and recognition ratio. For these problems, a recognition strategy based on the information propagation between the same level of neighboring processing data (i.e. horizontal propagation) and between different levels of processing data (i.e. vertical propagation) is successful. We discuss a pipeline-like recognition strategy based on information propagation.},

Compared with sequential decoding and macro-block level parallelism, the proposed method achieves optimal balance between performance and scalability. The optimization scheme is mapped on a 64-bit {MIPS} multi-core processor, and is evaluated with standard test streams. Experimental results show that the method improves video decoding performance by 2 times on average without increasing memory consumption, and could be easily applied on other multi-core processors.},

	abstract = {As network function virtualization ({NFV}) is realized based on general-purpose processors for avoiding proprietary hardware, its benefits of flexibility and agility could be compromised by the increased packet latency and reduced throughput. An effective approach for improving the latency and throughput performance is to exploit new network function ({NF}) processing framework on general purpose processors. In this paper, we propose a new joint two-tier {NF} parallelization ({TNP}) framework, which can agilely and flexibly organize parallel {NF} processing to greatly improve the latency and throughput performance of service function chain ({SFC}) which is constituted by a set of {NFs}. In {TNP}, we jointly organize the parallelization of multiple {NFs} at the service tier and perform multicore mapping of individual {NFs} at the substrate network tier. We formulate the optimal {TNP} design problem as minimizing link bandwidth consumption subject to end-to-end latency and computing resource constraints. We solve the problem by decomposing it into two easier subproblems: 1) subproblem 1 ({SP}1) is to solve the optimal {SFC} parallelization graph design in conjunction with link mapping problem and 2) subproblem 2 ({SP}2) is to jointly solve computing resource allocation in conjunction with node mapping problem. The global optimal solution is accomplished by searching in a set of feasible regions in sequence. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed {TNP} can significantly decrease service latency and improve network throughput compared with known single layer {NF} parallelization schemes. Moreover, the link bandwidth utilization and {SFC} request acceptance rate in the substrate network can also be greatly improved.},

	abstract = {In 5G-and-beyond wireless communication systems, Network Function Virtualization ({NFV}) has been widely acknowledged as an important network architecture solution to meet diverse service requirements in various scenarios. However, with the increase of network functions, the introduction of {NFV} may significantly increase the delay of traffic flows, which is much undesired, especially for Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communication ({URLLC}) service. Network Function Parallelism ({NFP}) architecture has been recently proposed as an effective technique to address the bottleneck of {NFV} technology. {NFP} can potentially improve the reliability and reduce the delay of service function chains ({SFCs}). In this paper, we propose a learning based {SFC} deployment strategy under {NFP} architecture with aim to improve the service reliability while reducing the end-to-end service delay. Specifically, service reliability is improved by deploying back-up virtual network function ({VNF}) nodes, while the flow delay is reduced via parallel network function processing. We formulate the {VNF} deployment as an integer-programming problem with objective of minimizing the reserved computing and bandwidth resources, while guaranteeing the service reliability and end-to-end delay. Considering the hardness and properties of the problem, we transform it as a Markov Decision Process ({MDP}), and employ a reinforcement-learning algorithm to solve it. We conduct simulations and the numerical results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can significantly improve the service reliability and delay performance, which are crucial for {URLLC} service.},

	abstract = {The emergence of Network Function Virtualization ({NFV}) and Service Function Chaining ({SFC}) together enable flexible and agile network management and traffic engineering. Due to the sequential execution nature of {SFC}, the latency would grow linearly with the number of functions. To resolve this issue, function parallelization has recently been proposed to enable independent functions to work simultaneously. Existing solutions, however, assume all the function instances are installed in the same physical machine and, thus, can be parallelized with only a little overhead. Nowadays, most of the networks deploy function instances in distributed servers for load balancing, parallelization across different servers would, in fact, introduce a non-negligible cost of duplicating or merging packets. Hence, in this work, we propose {PPC} (Partial Parallel Chaining), which only parallelizes functions if parallelization can indeed reduce the latency after considering function placement and the required additional parallelization cost. To this end, we design two schemes, partial parallelism enumeration and instance assignment to identify the optimal partial parallelism that minimizes the latency. Our simulation results show that {PPC} effectively adapts the degree of parallelism and, hence, outperforms both sequential chaining and full parallelism in any general scenario. Overall, the latency reduction can be up to 47.2\% and 35.2\%, respectively, as compared to sequential chaining and full parallelism.},
